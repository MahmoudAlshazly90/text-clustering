# Text Clustering Project

## Description

The Text Clustering Project aims to group similar text documents into clusters using unsupervised learning techniques. This project employs clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN to analyze and categorize text data based on their semantic content. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and vectorize the text before applying clustering algorithms.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization to prepare text data for clustering.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT) to convert text into numerical features.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Implements various clustering methods such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations of clusters using techniques like t-SNE or PCA to reduce dimensionality and facilitate interpretation.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses metrics such as Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index to evaluate the quality of clusters.

## Dependencies

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
- gensim (for Word2Vec)
- tensorflow (for BERT embeddings, if applicable)
